-As root use fallocate to create a swap file the size of your choosing (M = Megabytes, G = Gigabytes). For example, creating a 512 MB swap file:
	sudo su
	fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
	-Note: fallocate may cause problems with some file systems such as F2FS or XFS.[1] As an alternative, using dd is more reliable, but slower:
		dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096

-Set the right permissions (a world-readable swap file is a huge local vulnerability)
	chmod 600 /swapfile

-After creating the correctly sized file, format it to swap:
	mkswap /swapfile

-Activate the swap file:
	swapon /swapfile

-Finally, edit fstab to add an entry for the swap file:
	kwrite /etc/fstab
#Swap /swapfile
/swapfile        none        swap        defaults        0 0


-To resize file just follow these steps:

-Make all swap off
	sudo su
	swapoff -a

-Resize the swapfile
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096

-Reset permissions
	chmod 600 /swapfile

-Make swapfile usable
	mkswap /swapfile

-Make swapon again
	swapon /swapfile
